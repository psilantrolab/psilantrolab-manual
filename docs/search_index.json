["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Welcome to the Computational and Translational Neuropsychiatry Lab (PsiLANTRO Lab). This manual was developed by me, Eduardo Garza, lab PI. It is intended to be a beginners guide into the lab and to provide my vision of how the lab should function. It is also intended to be a reminder of how to conduct yourself in the lab and with your peers, and to provide information on how to proceed if this code of conduct is not being followed by your peers. ALL lab members will be expected to read this lab manual. It may update with time. This manual was inspired by other similar works for example the Grange-Lab manual.

["overview.html", "Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Mission 2.2 Core values 2.3 Expectations", " Chapter 2 Overview 2.1 Mission “We conduct rigurous basic multi-species research focused on finding behavioral, neuroimaging, and other biological biomarkers in substance use disorders and other neuropsychiatric disorders, to use this knowledge to tackle applied and clinical questions, such as researching new treatments like neuromodulation.” This mission statement guides all work conducted in the lab, from BSc to independent post-doctoral students. A mission statement is important as it allows the lab to focus our efforts on a particular direction. Neuroscience is a large discipline, and without focus our work will have less impact. Individual projects won’t (necessarily) address all aspects of this mission statement (except the rigorous part!), but the work of the lab as a whole will. Here I unpack some key terms in this mission statement: Rigorous: All work conducted in the lab should be rigorously-conducted. We take our science very seriously, and we ensure that the work we conduct is of the highest quality. As part of this rigour, we ensure that our studies are addressing important questions. Basic Research: Science typically falls into one of two categories: Fundamental (or “basic” / “pure”) research, and Applied research. Fundamental research aims to improve scientific theories, generate new ideas, and discover new empirical phenomena, without the promise of an immediate application of this knowledge. It is often referred to as the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake. An important part of our research strategy is to conduct fundamental research into neuropsychiatric disorders. We conduct this fundamental research to develop a better understanding of substance use disorders and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Multi-species: To create improvements in diagnosis and treatment of substance use and neuropsychiatric disorders, the basic and traslational study working with several species is fundamental and necessary. We work with mice, rats, non-human primates and humans ethically and respectfully. Neuroimaging: Our main tool is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), however, we also work with other techniques such as microscopy, electroencephalography, local-field potentials, among others. You will need to learn the basics of multiple techniques with a main focus on MRI. Substance Use Disorders: This is the main topic of research within the lab. All work conducted—whether it is fundamental work or applied—should address a question regarding substance use disorders (SUDs). SUDs refer to any type of substance in multiple species. Neuropsychiatric disorders: Here we work in the line between neurology and psychiatry, without separating both that much. Substance use disorders are an example of a neuropsychiatric disorder. Applied and Clinical Questions: The lab aspires to improve diagnosis and treatment of SUDs and neuropsychiatric disorders by using the knowledge derived from basic multi-species research. Neuromodulation: It refers to the manipultation of central and/or perpheric nervous systems activity by means of electrical or ultrasonic stimulation or chemical agents. It can be invasive, such as deep brain stimulation and non-invasive, such as trascranial magnetic stimulation. 2.2 Core values The lab holds itself to several core values: Ambition: We are an ambitious lab, and I expect all members to show ambition in their work. I will help you to make sure your project is ambitiously relevant to your current stage (i.e., MSc projects will be more ambitious than BSc projects). Note that this also refers to personal ambition, and is independent of your current ability: I want you to be the best “you” that you can be. Commitment: Good science requires commitment. You should be committed to your project by having clear goals which are SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound. Enthusiasm: Hard work is difficult without enthusiasm. It is therefore important that you work on a project that is both of value to the lab’s mission and of interest to you. Excellence: We strive for excellence in all that we do. No half-done stuff. Honesty: We value honesty in all of our work and communications, even when this is difficult. Independence: It is important that we take ownership of our individual projects. We are able to work independently, but importantly feel secure to ask questions when help is required. Team Work: Although we are all working on independent projects, they all map on to our lab’s mission. We are therefore a team, and as such help and support each other as much as possible. We meet regularly, and provide open, honest, and respectful feedback on each other’s work. 2.3 Expectations 2.3.1 Everyone We expect each other to: Push the envelope of scientific discovery &amp; personal excellence. Do work we are proud of individually and as a group. Do work that others will care about. Double-check our work. Being a little obsessive is essential to good science. Be supportive of our lab-mates. We are a team. Work independently when we can, but ask for help when we need it. Communicate honestly, especially when it is difficult (e.g., share our mistakes). Share our knowledge. Mentorship takes many forms. Respect each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and differences. Diversity is to be celebrated. Respect all types of people and beliefs. Be able to work directly or indirectly with multiple species, mainly: mice, rats, non-human primates and humans. 2.3.2 Principal Investigator As well as the above, you can expect me to: Have a vision for where the lab is going. Obtain the funding to support the science, and the people (where appropriate), in the lab. Meet with you regularly to discuss your research projects. The definition of “regularly” may change over time or over the course of a project, but unless we agree otherwise the expectation is that this will be once per week. Support you in your career development, regardless of your current stage. This includes discussing professional development, writing letters of recommendation, and promoting your work in conference presentations I attend. Care about you as a person and not just as a scientist. Obsess over many things related to your project &amp; its eventual dissemination, from font choice, punctuation / grammar, and data visualisation. It will drive you nuts. Hold high expectations of you: These expectations are there because I believe you can reach them. 2.3.3 Bachelor Students Develop a project that fits with the mission of the lab. If you are unsure on what project you should work on, I can provide a project for you. This will not affect your final grade. Communicate frequently with me. One of the skills we wish to develop in you is project management, so keep me up to date regularly with your progress. Be punctual with our meetings. Care about data quality. Conduct your empirical work under strict lab conditions: minimize distractions; ensure the participant is engaged with the experiment (humans); be consistent with your protocols. When conducting experiments, be professional at all times with your participants. Be on time. Be polite. Provide a good debrief. If your subject is a non-human animal, be kind and ethical. When you are stuck on a problem, try to solve it yourself first. If you then need help, please ask me. But when you ask, I expect that you tell me what you have tried yourself to solve the problem. Keep notes of our meetings. It is up to you to maintain thorough notes to ensure an accurate record of what we discussed and what was agreed. Stay up-to-date (and keep me informed) on any deadlines that you need to meet. 2.3.4 Master Students As well as the above, I expect Master students to: Be more independent in all aspects of the project. Develop a line of research that could lead to a publishable piece of work. Although this is not a requirement for the Master degree itself, remember that the lab has high expectations. Pre-register your study at the Open Science Framework or similar framework. Develop &amp; communicate clear instructions to help me program your experimental with you. Take an active interest in how the experiment is done. Learn to program: Learn the statistical programming language R using R Studio. Learn how to use RMarkdown, and eventually writing your reports this way. Understand that there is a steep learning curve associated with all of the above, but that you will be better off for having learned them. Take the lead on data preparation and analysis. Share your data &amp; analysis publicly. I’ll tell you how as this changes everyday. Develop a healthy work–life balance. Take time off regularly, guilt-free. I will do the same. Practice self-care Realize there are times for pulling all-nighters, and times for not coming into work and having some fun. 2.3.5 PhD Students As well as the above, I expect PhD students to: Strive to know the literature related to your topic like the back of your hand. Develop a line of dissertation research leading to publishable output (conferences and journal papers). Seek out and apply for fellowship and awards (including travel awards for conference attendance etc.). Develop as an independent scientist: In Year 1, be guided by my instructions In Year 2, challenge some of my instructions &amp; start to tell me what you’re doing *In Year 3+, take full ownership Consider contributing to teaching where possible, but especially if you wish to pursue an academic career post-PhD. Some options could be: Lead seminars Teach in my courses Co-supervise Bachelor and Master student projects. "],
["communication.html", "Chapter 3 Communication 3.1 My door 3.2 Email 3.3 Booking a meeting with me 3.4 Lab meetings", " Chapter 3 Communication I am usually busier than I would like to be, and as a result have less time for talking to people than I would like. However, you (lab members) are one of the most important parts of my job, and I need your help to stay organised and involved in the things that I need to be involved in. Some general guidelines: Be proactive. Tell me what you need. This includes coming to knock on my door, emailing me, setting up a meeting, or catching me in the corridor. Write things down and remind me what we’ve talked about. I would love to remember every small detail that we decided when we met last week, but this doesn’t always happen. Don’t hesitate to bring me up to speed when we meet. Even if I already remember what we are talking about, a couple of introductory topic sentences will help us both get in the right frame of mind. Be sure to take notes of our meetings. Read all of the lab documentation. That includes this lab manual, but also your course documentation. You are responsible for knowing what is in each of these places, following the rules and guidelines we have set up, and notifying someone if you find incorrect information (or if you have questions). Be strategic in what you ask me. Please check the lab manual, University / School documentation, and/or a Google search before asking me something. 3.1 My door Metaphorically, my door is always open, but sometimes my door is physically closed. If this is the case: If we have a meeting scheduled for that time, please do knock even if I am in a meeting. Sometimes I will continue a meeting if it seems that my next appointment has not turned up, so please do let me know you have arrived. If I don’t answer the door it means I cannot open. Send me a message instead. If we do not have a meeting scheduled, consider instead dropping me an email. Of course, if it’s an emergency then please knock anyway. 3.2 Email Now that the lab has moved to Slack for team communication, I tend to rely less on my email as the primary form of communication with lab members. I would therefore strongly encourage you to communicate with me via Slack rather than email. However, you can of course send an email if you would prefer, especially for more sensitive matters. 3.3 Booking a meeting with me Email me if you need a meeting. I’ll check my schedule and book you. 3.4 Lab meetings We meet collectively once each week to talk about science together, to discuss common issues, and to make sure we have a chance to discuss our individual research projects. Regular attendance is expected, as is active-participation (presenting, asking questions, etc). "],
["science.html", "Chapter 4 Science 4.1 Consortiums 4.2 Scientific Integrity 4.3 Reproducible Science 4.4 Open Science 4.5 Publication of Our Work", " Chapter 4 Science 4.1 Consortiums Firstly, we are members of several consortiums: ENIGMA-Addiction World-wide Consortium. 9,000 SUD scans are counting. International Networks of tES /TMS Trials for Addiction Medicine - INTAM. New network of researchers. PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) Consortium. Non-human primate neuroimaging research. Mexico Borderline Personality Disorder (BDP) Research Group. Check the websites and perhaps you would want to work in any of those efforts. 4.2 Scientific Integrity You have a responsibility to me, each other, the institutions that support our work, and the broader scientific community to uphold the highest standards of scientific accuracy and integrity. By being in the lab you agree to adhere to professional ethical standards. There is never an excuse for fabricating or misrepresenting data. If you have any questions, or in the unlikely event that you have concerns about a research practice you have seen in the lab, please talk to me immediately. It is also important that you prioritize the accuracy of your work while in the lab. Unintentional errors due to inattentiveness or rushing can be extremely damaging and produce results that turn out to be incorrect. Although there is always a pressure for a high quantity of research, it is critical that everything we do is of the highest quality. Please double-check your work frequently. However, mistakes happen, and it is part of being human. Please feel secure in admitting your mistakes so we can all learn from them. There is no blame culture in the lab. 4.3 Reproducible Science Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced. This is related to replicability, in that it has to do with your ability to get the same results again, but it refers specifically to getting the same results given the same set of data. That is, if I was to take your raw data and follow the same steps that you took in your analysis, would I get exactly the same outcome? Replicability is something different: If you find an experimental effect, would I be able to find the same effect if I was to conduct an independent replication of your experiment? I expect that all of our research will be, at minimum, reproducible (I hope that it will also be replicable!). Conducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds, because it requires that you are organised and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. Extensive note-taking (i.e., as much as you can manage) will help improve the reproducibility of your work. If you are a BSc student, you can increase reproducibility by documenting all stages of your analysis in sufficient detail such that anyone could follow your steps exactly. If using SPSS or JASP, make notes of what menu options you chose and in what order. Did you exclude any data? If so, document why. Did you transform any variales? if so, document why. If you are an MSc student or higher, I would be expecting you to code for your analysis so that you have a script of your analysis code. Code is your friend. Of couse, I am always on hand to help out if needed. I find that it is easier to do reproducible science when you do these things: Google Drive or Dropbox folder for the project, with the example template folders I use (ask me). New Github repository of the project for code. New OSF project, with a connection to the Google Drive and Github. Keep the R, python and SSH code clean as possible. If you can’t be clean, you can do a new folder for reproducibility, self contained. This means the new code will use those same folders and files, and make sure it works. When you make the Readme for the Github repo, write down exactly all the steps so other people can reproduce. 4.4 Open Science As a lab we engage actively in the principles of Open Science. This refers to the movement to make all aspects of the scientific process open and accessible to all, for free. Working in accordance to open science practices increases the transparency, accessibility, and the impact of our work. It allows other researchers to utilise our methods, access our data, and read about our research easily. In our work, we strive to achieve all three badges recently introduced by the Center for Open Science, which are pre-registration, open data and open materials. Pre-registration is time expensive and sometimes difficult to attain, but the rest are necessary. 4.4.1 Open Data We share all of our anonymised raw data online at the Open Science Framework, Open Neuro, Zenodo and NeuroVault. This allows all readers of our work to be able to access our data, either to verify our analyses (and hence conclusions) or for further independent analysis. 4.4.2 Open Materials We share all of our materials used in our experimental protocol as well as code. This can be done in Github more easily. 4.4.3 Pre-registration If you have read the Simmons et al. (2012) — False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant paper from the “Essential Readings” chapter, you are probably of the opinion that researchers should decide ahead of time what exclusion criteria they plan to adopt and which analyses they plan to conduct on their data. An elegant solution to this is to pre-register your hypotheses, experiment plan, and data analysis procedures. Put simply, this means that you declare ahead of time what you plan to do, and only then do you go and do it. Of course, it’s always nice to be able to prove that you did indeed plan things ahead of time. This is where online pre-registration resources such as https://aspredicted.org/] come in handy. Researchers complete an online form by answering 9 questions about the design, hypotheses, and analysis of their study. This form is then saved online and time-stamped to prove the date that the registraton occured. This can also be done with OSF, although its a bit more complicated. For meta-analysis we use PROSPERO. For clinical trials we use ClinicalTrials.gov 4.5 Publication of Our Work All work conducted in the lab should be of such a quality that it is of a publishable standard. That is, the question should be of scientific importance, the study should be designed so that the outcome will be informative in respect to the question, and the data should be of the highest quality (this is aided by good experimenter conduct &amp; control during the running of the study). I expect you to aim for these standards during your project, whether you are a BSc student or a post-doc. For authorships, we use the ICME Guidelines: The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria: Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND Final approval of the version to be published; AND Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved. It is also important to acknowledge the rest of the people that had something to do with the work, especially Technicians. The student is usually first author when they do most of the work, including writing the first draft. But this will differ depending on the circumstances. As principle investigator of the lab, I expect to be an author on all papers produced by lab members. But please note that I do not get automatic authorship; rather, my expectation is that you should involve me in your work to such a degree that I have earned authorship on the paper. "],
["essential-reading.html", "Chapter 5 Essential Reading 5.1 Labs 5.2 Open Science 5.3 Substance use disorders 5.4 Neuromodulation for SUDs 5.5 Neuroimaging 5.6 Animal Neuroimaging", " Chapter 5 Essential Reading Although we are all working on individual projects that have their own literature to read, below I have outlined some papers which I believe are essential reading for new scientists. First I include the must read lab papers for any new members. 5.1 Labs Garza-Villarreal et al. (2020) - Clinical and functional connectivity outcomes of 5-Hz repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation as an add-on treatment in cocaine use disorder: a double-blind randomized controlled trial. This our most important work to date that will be followed by new questions. Pando-Naude et al. (2020) - Gray and white matter morphology in substance use disorders: A neuroimaging systematic review and meta-analysis. In this paper we summarize and expand on volume findings in SUDs. Garza-Villarreal et al. (2017) - The effect of crack cocaine addiction and age on the microstructure and morphology of the human striatum and thalamus using shape analysis and fast diffusion kurtosis imaging. Here we show some of the methods that we use every day for structural imaging. Milham et al. (2020) - Accelerating the evolution of nonhuman primate neuroimaging. Here is a summary of all problems in non-human primate imaging and new oportunities for research. 5.2 Open Science Open Science Collaboration (2015) — Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science. This paper reports the attempt to replicate 100 experimental findings from 3 prominent journals in the pschological sciences. The outcome of the study is quite grim, highlighting the poor replication rates of findings in psychology. Simmons et al. (2012) — False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant. This paper introduces the concept of “researcher degrees of freedom”: If researchers have several ways to collect &amp; analyse their data (i.e., “fishing expeditions”), they can try combinations of different methods (implicitly or explicitly) in order to find a significant effect, even if it is not real. Wagenmakers et al. (2011) — An agenda for purely confirmatory research. Building on the Simmons et al. paper, this paper by Wagenmakers and colleagues provides a fantastic introduction to the problem of exploratory research being presented as confirmatory research. 5.3 Substance use disorders Volkow et al. (2019) - The Neuroscience of Drug Reward and Addiction. A great overview of substance use neuroscience. 5.4 Neuromodulation for SUDs Ekhitari et al. (2019) - Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation (tES and TMS) for addiction medicine: A consensus paper on the present state of the science and the road ahead. Hanlon et al. (2018) - Modulating Neural Circuits with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Implications for Addiction Treatment Development. Great review by one of the leading experts in the field. 5.5 Neuroimaging Esteban et al. (2018) - fMRIPrep: a robust preprocessing pipeline for functional MRI. Our standard pipeline for preprocessing at the moment. 5.6 Animal Neuroimaging Grandjean et al. (2016) - Common functional networks in the mouse brain revealed by multi-centre resting-state fMRI analysis. An effort to find common networks in rodent fMRI. Grandjean et al.
