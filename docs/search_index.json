["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction Welcome to the Computational and Translational Neuropsychiatry Lab (PsiLANTRO Lab). This manual was developed by me, Eduardo Garza, lab PI. It is intended to be a beginners guide into the lab and to provide my vision of how the lab should function. It is also intended to be a reminder of how to conduct yourself in the lab and with your peers, and to provide information on how to proceed if this code of conduct is not being followed by your peers. ALL lab members will be expected to read this lab manual. It may update with time. This manual was inspired by other similar works for example the Grange-Lab manual. This manual is licence under a CC Attribution 4.0 Licence. This is our website PsiLANTRO Lab. Make sure to send me your picture to add you as a student on the website. New students should first do the following: Get a Gmail account. Get a Github account. Download Slack. Get a free Asana account. Get an Open Science Framework account. Let me (Eduardo) know when you do this so I can add you to the lab accounts. Ask me for a C13 Cluster account and a LAVIS account, sending me your full name and program. Our Wiki can help you with tutorials and documentation for tools we use at the lab. "]
