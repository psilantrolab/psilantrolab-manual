# Essential Reading

Although we are all working on individual projects that have their own literature to read, below I have outlined some papers which I believe are essential reading for new scientists.

First I include the must read lab papers for any new members.

## Labs

[Garza-Villarreal et al. (2020) - Clinical and functional connectivity outcomes of 5-Hz repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation as an add-on treatment in cocaine use disorder: a double-blind randomized controlled trial](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.15.20154708v1). This our most important work to date that will be followed by new questions.

[Pando-Naude et al. (2020) - Gray and white matter morphology in substance use disorders: A neuroimaging systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.122812v1). In this paper we summarize and expand on volume findings in SUDs.

[Garza-Villarreal et al. (2017) - The effect of crack cocaine addiction and age on the microstructure and morphology of the human striatum and thalamus using shape analysis and fast diffusion kurtosis imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201792). Here we show some of the methods that we use every day for structural imaging.

[Milham et al. (2020) - Accelerating the evolution of nonhuman primate neuroimaging](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731931089X). Here is a summary of all problems in non-human primate imaging and new oportunities for research.

## Open Science

[Open Science Collaboration (2015) — Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science](https://bit.ly/2JIFWNt). This paper reports the attempt to replicate 100 experimental findings from 3 prominent journals in the pschological sciences. The outcome of the study is quite grim, highlighting the poor replication rates of findings in psychology.

[Simmons et al. (2012) — False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417632). This paper introduces the concept of “researcher degrees of freedom”: If researchers have several ways to collect & analyse their data (i.e., “fishing expeditions”), they can try combinations of different methods (implicitly or explicitly) in order to find a significant effect, even if it is not real.

[Wagenmakers et al. (2011) — An agenda for purely confirmatory research.](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2012/WagenmakersEtAl2012PoPS.pdf) Building on the Simmons et al. paper, this paper by Wagenmakers and colleagues provides a fantastic introduction to the problem of exploratory research being presented as confirmatory research.

## Substance use disorders

[Volkow et al. (2019) - The Neuroscience of Drug Reward and Addiction](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00014.2018). A great overview of substance use neuroscience.

## Neuromodulation for SUDs

[Ekhitari et al. (2019) - Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation (tES and TMS) for addiction medicine: A consensus paper on the present state of the science and the road ahead](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149763419303070). 

[Hanlon et al. (2018) - Modulating Neural Circuits with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Implications for Addiction Treatment Development](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/70/3/661). Great review by one of the leading experts in the field. 

## Neuroimaging

[Esteban et al. (2018) - fMRIPrep: a robust preprocessing pipeline for functional MRI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4). Our standard pipeline for preprocessing at the moment.

## Animal Neuroimaging

[Grandjean et al. (2016) - Common functional networks in the mouse brain revealed by multi-centre resting-state fMRI analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811919308699?via%3Dihub). An effort to find common networks in rodent fMRI.

[Grandjean et al. (2014) - Optimization of anesthesia protocol for resting-state fMRI in mice based on differential effects of anesthetics on functional connectivity patterns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811914007174?via%3Dihub). About rodent anesthesia for fMRI.

[Diaz-Parra et al. (2017) - Structural and functional, empirical and modeled connectivity in the cerebral cortex of the rat](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811917306146?via%3Dihub). On the rat structural and functional connectome.
