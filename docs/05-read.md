# Essential Reading

Although we are all working on individual projects that have their own literature to read, below I have outlined some papers which I believe are essential reading for new scientists.

First I include the must read lab papers for any new members.

## Lab

[Garza-Villarreal, E. A., Moy, L., Mao, H., Hussain, T., Lupo, J. M., Fleischer, C. C., & Scott, A. D. (2024). Ethical considerations of preclinical models in imaging research. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine: Official Journal of the Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine / Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, 91(3), 858–859.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.29920). 

[Rasgado-Toledo, J., Issa-Garcia, V., Alcalá-Lozano, R., Garza-Villarreal, E. A., & González-Escamilla, G. (2024). Cortical and subcortical microstructure integrity changes after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy in cocaine use disorder and relates to clinical outcomes. Addiction Biology, 29(2), e13381.]( https://doi.org/10.1111/adb.13381)
[Garza-Villarreal, E. A., Alcala-Lozano, R., Fernandez-Lozano, S., Morelos-Santana, E., Dávalos, A., Villicaña, V., Alcauter, S., Castellanos, F. X., & Gonzalez-Olvera, J. J. (2021). Clinical and Functional Connectivity Outcomes of 5-Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation as an Add-on Treatment in Cocaine Use Disorder: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial. Biological Psychiatry. Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging, 6(7), 745–757.]( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.01.003)

[Pando-Naude et al. (2020) - Gray and white matter morphology in substance use disorders: A neuroimaging systematic review and meta-analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.29.122812v1). 

[Garza-Villarreal et al. (2017) - The effect of crack cocaine addiction and age on the microstructure and morphology of the human striatum and thalamus using shape analysis and fast diffusion kurtosis imaging](https://www.nature.com/articles/tp201792). 


## Open Science

[Open Science Collaboration (2015) — Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science](https://bit.ly/2JIFWNt). This paper reports the attempt to replicate 100 experimental findings from 3 prominent journals in the pschological sciences. The outcome of the study is quite grim, highlighting the poor replication rates of findings in psychology.

[Simmons et al. (2012) — False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417632). This paper introduces the concept of “researcher degrees of freedom”: If researchers have several ways to collect & analyse their data (i.e., “fishing expeditions”), they can try combinations of different methods (implicitly or explicitly) in order to find a significant effect, even if it is not real.

[Wagenmakers et al. (2011) — An agenda for purely confirmatory research.](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2012/WagenmakersEtAl2012PoPS.pdf) Building on the Simmons et al. paper, this paper by Wagenmakers and colleagues provides a fantastic introduction to the problem of exploratory research being presented as confirmatory research.

## Substance use disorders

[Volkow et al. (2019) - The Neuroscience of Drug Reward and Addiction](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/physrev.00014.2018). A great overview of substance use neuroscience.

## Neuromodulation for SUDs

[Ekhitari et al. (2019) - Transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation (tES and TMS) for addiction medicine: A consensus paper on the present state of the science and the road ahead](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0149763419303070). 

[Hanlon et al. (2018) - Modulating Neural Circuits with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Implications for Addiction Treatment Development](http://pharmrev.aspetjournals.org/content/70/3/661). Great review by one of the leading experts in the field. 

## Neuroimaging

[Esteban et al. (2018) - fMRIPrep: a robust preprocessing pipeline for functional MRI](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0235-4). Our standard pipeline for preprocessing at the moment.

## Animal Neuroimaging
