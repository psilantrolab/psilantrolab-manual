## Consortiums

Firstly, we are members of several consortiums:

* [ENIGMA-Addiction World-wide Consortium](https://www.enigmaaddictionconsortium.com/). 9,000 SUD scans are counting.
* [International Networks of tES /TMS Trials for Addiction Medicine - INTAM](https://twitter.com/INTAM_Network). New network of researchers.
* [PRIMatE Data Exchange (PRIME-DE) Consortium](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/indiPRIME.html). Non-human primate neuroimaging research.
* Mexico Borderline Personality Disorder (BDP) Research Group.

Check the websites and perhaps you would want to work in any of those efforts.


## Scientific Integrity

You have a responsibility to me, each other, the institutions that support our work, and the broader scientific community to uphold the highest standards of scientific accuracy and integrity. By being in the lab you agree to adhere to professional ethical standards. There is never an excuse for fabricating or misrepresenting data. If you have any questions, or in the unlikely event that you have concerns about a research practice you have seen in the lab, please talk to me immediately.

It is also important that you prioritize the accuracy of your work while in the lab. Unintentional errors due to inattentiveness or rushing can be extremely damaging and produce results that turn out to be incorrect. Although there is always a pressure for a high quantity of research, it is critical that everything we do is of the highest quality. Please double-check your work frequently. However, mistakes happen, and it is part of being human. Please feel secure in admitting your mistakes so we can all learn from them. There is no blame culture in the lab.

## Reproducible Science

Reproducible research is research that can be exactly reproduced. This is related to replicability, in that it has to do with your ability to get the same results again, but it refers specifically to getting the same results given the same set of data. That is, if I was to take your raw data and follow the same steps that you took in your analysis, would I get exactly the same outcome? Replicability is something different: If you find an experimental effect, would I be able to find the same effect if I was to conduct an independent replication of your experiment?

I expect that all of our research will be, at minimum, reproducible (I hope that it will also be replicable!).

Conducting reproducible research is more difficult than it sounds, because it requires that you are organised and possess sufficient foresight to document each step of your research process. Extensive note-taking (i.e., as much as you can manage) will help improve the reproducibility of your work.

If you are a BSc student, you can increase reproducibility by documenting all stages of your analysis in sufficient detail such that anyone could follow your steps exactly. If using SPSS or JASP, make notes of what menu options you chose and in what order. Did you exclude any data? If so, document why. Did you transform any variales? if so, document why.

If you are an MSc student or higher, I would be expecting you to code for your analysis so that you have a script of your analysis code. Code is your friend. Of couse, I am always on hand to help out if needed.

I find that it is easier to do reproducible science when you do these things:

1. Google Drive or Dropbox folder for the project, with the example template folders I use  (ask me).
2. New Github repository of the project for code.
3. New OSF project, with a connection to the Google Drive and Github.
4. Keep the R, python and SSH code clean as possible.
5. If you can't be clean, you can do a new folder for reproducibility, self contained. This means the new code will use those same folders and files, and make sure it works. 
6. When you make the Readme for the Github repo, write down exactly all the steps so other people can reproduce.

## Open Science
As a lab we engage actively in the principles of Open Science. This refers to the movement to make all aspects of the scientific process open and accessible to all, for free. Working in accordance to open science practices increases the transparency, accessibility, and the impact of our work. It allows other researchers to utilise our methods, access our data, and read about our research easily.

In our work, we strive to achieve all three badges recently introduced by the Center for Open Science, which are pre-registration, open data and open materials. Pre-registration is time expensive and sometimes difficult to attain, but the rest are necessary.

### Open Data
We share all of our anonymised raw data online at the Open Science Framework, Open Neuro, Zenodo and NeuroVault. This allows all readers of our work to be able to access our data, either to verify our analyses (and hence conclusions) or for further independent analysis. 

### Open Materials
We share all of our materials used in our experimental protocol as well as code. This can be done in Github more easily.

### Pre-registration
If you have read the [Simmons et al. (2012) — False-positive psychology: Undisclosed flexibility in data collection and analysis allows presenting anything as significant](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611417632) paper from the “Essential Readings” chapter, you are probably of the opinion that researchers should decide ahead of time what exclusion criteria they plan to adopt and which analyses they plan to conduct on their data. An elegant solution to this is to pre-register your hypotheses, experiment plan, and data analysis procedures. Put simply, this means that you declare ahead of time what you plan to do, and only then do you go and do it.

Of course, it’s always nice to be able to prove that you did indeed plan things ahead of time. This is where online pre-registration resources such as [https://aspredicted.org/](https://aspredicted.org/)] come in handy. Researchers complete an online form by answering 9 questions about the design, hypotheses, and analysis of their study. This form is then saved online and time-stamped to prove the date that the registraton occured.

This can also be done with OSF, although its a bit more complicated.

For meta-analysis we use [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).

For clinical trials we use [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/)

## Publication of Our Work

All work conducted in the lab should be of such a quality that it is of a publishable standard. That is, the question should be of scientific importance, the study should be designed so that the outcome will be informative in respect to the question, and the data should be of the highest quality (this is aided by good experimenter conduct & control during the running of the study). I expect you to aim for these standards during your project, whether you are a BSc student or a post-doc.

For authorships, we use the [ICME Guidelines](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html):

The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria:

* Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the work; AND
* Drafting the work or revising it critically for important intellectual content; AND
* Final approval of the version to be published; AND
* Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.

It is also important to acknowledge the rest of the people that had something to do with the work, especially Technicians.

The student is usually first author when they do most of the work, including writing the first draft. But this will differ depending on the circumstances.

As principle investigator of the lab, I expect to be an author on all papers produced by lab members. But please note that I do not get automatic authorship; rather, my expectation is that you should involve me in your work to such a degree that I have earned authorship on the paper.
